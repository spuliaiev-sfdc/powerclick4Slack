Hi, I am Sergii from ECC backend team.
My current project is a Slack plugin. Slack is a great system to collaborate withing company
and my plugin allows to make different systems in such huge company as Salesforce a bit closer to each other.
This idea came from my previous Hack days projects -
PowerClick bookmarklet for Browsers and
PowerClick plugin for IntelliJ.

For example - when we referencing some work item we post it's url into Slack.
Like that:
| He folks, take a look at these work items they has a lot of bugs:
| https://portal.prod.ci.sfdc.net/testfailures/bughandlerreport?bugNumber=W-8269157
| https://gus.my.salesforce.com/apex/ADM_WorkLocator?bugorworknumber=W-7882440
My plugin will catch this post and enhance it with additional link - like to AutomationPortal - so you do not need to go to the GUS only then to AutomationPortal.
I am working on catching the messages without url - by simply identifying them by prefix W-

Another case - let's say your manager asks to take a look at the failing test:
| Please take a look - it's failing for a long time:
| https://portal.prod.ci.sfdc.net/testhistory?loadLimit=50&pageType=status&testClass=conversation.library.SharingRecordCollectionInsertFTest&testName=testSaveUnderDifferentContextUserWithOwnerSpecified

And you immediately see the links to the file
in Swarm to check the file history
in CodeSearch to see the actual content of the file
in AutomationPortal to see the history of failures

in Kodama to verify it's ownership
Also - you get information about which team owns it and link to a report with the list of files this team owns.

And even a link to open this file in your locally running IntelliJ IDE (If you have installed the PowerClick plugin already).
There you can go to particular method and get its history of executions.

That's a huge time-saver.

And this kind of information you can get on any Java class using command JavaClass:
/javaclass NetworkMemberGroupDataObject
/javaclass PersonAccountFlowTest

And it works both ways - I mean that tracking of URL for CodeSearch, Kodama, Swarm works the same way
