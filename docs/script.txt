Hi, I am Sergii from ECC backend team.
My current project is a Slack plugin. Slack is a great system to collaborate withing company
and my plugin allows to make different systems in such huge company as Salesforce a bit closer to each other.

For example - when we referencing some work item we post it's url into Slack.
Like that:
| He folks, take a look at these work items they has a lot of bugs:
| https://portal.prod.ci.sfdc.net/testfailures/bughandlerreport?bugNumber=W-8269157
| https://gus.my.salesforce.com/apex/ADM_WorkLocator?bugorworknumber=W-7882440
My plugin will catch this post and enhance it with additional link - like to AutomationPortal - so you do not need to go to the GUS only then to AutomationPortal.
I am working on catching the messages without url - by simply identifying them by prefix W-

Another case - let's say your manager asks to take a look at the failing test:
| Please take a look - it's failing for a long time:
| https://portal.prod.ci.sfdc.net/testhistory?loadLimit=50&pageType=status&testClass=conversation.library.SharingRecordCollectionInsertFTest&testName=testSaveUnderDifferentContextUserWithOwnerSpecified

And you immediately see the links to the file
in Swarm to check the file history
in Kodama to verify it's ownership
in AutomationPortal to see the history of failures
The content of the file in the CodeSearch
And even a link to open this file in your locally running IntelliJ IDE (If you installed the PowerClick addon already)
Also - you get information about which team owns it and link to a report which other files this team owns.

It's a huge time-saver.

And this kind of information you can get on any Java class using command JavaClass:
/javaclass NetworkMemberGroupDataObject
/javaclass PersonAccountFlowTest.testPersonAccountLookupFlow

And it works both ways - I mean that tracking of URL for CodeSearch, Kodama, Swarm works the same way
